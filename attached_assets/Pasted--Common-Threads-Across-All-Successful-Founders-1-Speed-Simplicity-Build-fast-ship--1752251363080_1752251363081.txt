# Common Threads Across All Successful Founders

## 1. Speed & Simplicity  
- **Build fast, ship faster.** MVP in 6–14 days.  
- **One core problem.** Solve one thing exceptionally well.  
- **Validation through building.** Don’t overthink—build minimal and test with real users.

## 2. Reddit-First Marketing  
- **Primary channel.** 90 % of founders cite Reddit as their top acquisition source.  
- **Community-first.** Join existing subreddits, contribute value, then share.  
- **Free-first.** Launch free to gain acceptance before monetizing.

## 3. Zero-Budget Growth Tactics  
- **Organic content.** No paid ads in early stages.  
- **Viral loops.** Built-in sharing (forms, widgets, badges).  
- **Platform leverage.** Build on Notion, Shopify, etc., to tap into their communities.

## 4. Solo Operation Efficiency  
- **Same tech stack.** Stick to familiar tools.  
- **Copy-paste frameworks.** Reuse code/UI from past projects.  
- **AI-assisted development.** Use Cursor, Bolt, etc., for faster builds.
